									<h2>Using Acoustic Signal to predict grain size of bedload particles</h2>
									<p>
										Bedload transport is a potentially hazardous environmental process 
										that occurs in rivers during high-flow conditions. Indirect bedload 
										transport measuring systems relying on
										acoustic impact sensors help to obtain measurements of high temporal 
										resolution. In this work, we evaluated the use of machine
										learning approaches to predict the size of bedload particles based
										on indirect acoustic sensor measurements. Data from controlled
										field experiments was available for three measuring systems from
										the Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL: Swiss plate geophone
										(SPG), miniplate accelerometer (MPA), and square pipe system
										(SPS). A simple and a complex feature set (9 vs. 44 features
										for the SPG) were created from raw signals for all measuring
										systems. Out of 9 evaluated model types, CatBoost models in
										combination with the complex feature set performed best and
										achieved R2-scores above 0.8 for all measuring systems. Models
										trained on data of the most recently developed measuring system
										(SPS) achieved the best results with an R2-score of 0.84. Finally,
										a feature relevance analysis revealed that the spectral roll-off and
										spectral centroid contributed most to the model predictions.

									<h2>Nlp model for polarity classification of crypto tweets</h2>
									<p>
										The goal of the project was to compare two different models based on text data. 
										We used a simple approach with text processing and a more complex approach with 
										a deep learning model. For the simpler approach we agreed on a Linear Support 
										Vector Machine (SVM), which we want to compare with different preprocessing steps. 
										For the Deep Learning approach we agreed on a transformer model called BERT, 
										which is currently state-of-the-art in Natural Language Processing.
										For the dataset, we wrote our own scraper that fetches the data from the 
										Twitter API. The data is mainly related to new tweets that can be found 
										on the keyword "Ethereum". We collected from Twitter 70000 tweets of which, 
										however, some were duplicated in the dataset. After removing them, we still 
										found about 2000 distinct tweets in our own dataset. The dataset consists of 
										the text content of the tweet and the label. We have three different labels 
										Negative, Neutral, Positive. These are called the polarity of a tweet in the 
										sentinel analysis field. Using a GUI we created ourselves, we were then able 
										to label the 2000 distinct tweets.<br>
										The SVM model achieved an F1 score with a macro-mean (class imbalance) of 50.1%. 
										for the pre-trained transformer model from bert, we chose the version Distilbert 
										- a distilled version of Bert Transformer model. We used transfer learning to 
										train the model on our data. We were able to slightly increase the prediction 
										performance to 56% F1 score.

									<h2>Regression model to predict housing prices in Switzerland</h2>
									<p>In this challenge, we investigated a dataset of Swiss real estate using 
										machine learning methods. we developed several models to predict the 
										price of real estate objects as well as the object type, using numerous 
										attributes. The dataset contains about 150'000 real estate objects, 
										for which numerous attributes such as living space, number of rooms, 
										object type etc. as well as the price are listed. For the final model 
										we decided to use an XGBoost regression. This is a gradient boosted 
										tree algorithm. With this model we achieved a Mean Absolute Percentage 
										Error of 12.76%. We were able to achieve this result with many different 
										imputations and transformations. We then needed to make the model 
										available to potential customers, so we created an API where the data 
										is taken as JSON input and sent through a pipeline and then finally 
										delivers the prediction.</p>
